# Broken Stuff

- Not broken either but set up Nextcloud exporters.

- Some Nginx headers were commented out because it collided or something.
  Idfk. Make them not. Uncomment.

- QT theme doesn't work.

- Nushell custom prompt title does not work, as it gets
  overriden by the shell integration in a split second.
