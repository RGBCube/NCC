# My NixOS Configurations

This repository contains my NixOS configurations for all my machines.

## Bootstrapping

Here is the script you need to run to get this working:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **WILL NEED** `/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix`, as this configuration
> imports it, so you will need to run `sudo nixos-generate-config` if you've deleted them.

```sh
nix-shell -p git --command "git clone https://github.com/RGBCube/NixOSConfiguration && cd NixOSConfiguration"

./rebuild.sh
```

`machine-name` is a machine selected from the machines in the `machines` directory.

## Applying Changes

Lets say you have changed the configuration and want to apply the changes
to your system. You would have to run the rebuild script:

```sh
./rebuild.sh
```

This runs the script interactively.

You can also check how the script is used:

```sh
./rebuild.sh --help
```

This outputs:

```
Usage: ./rebuild.sh [-h | --help] [machine-name]
```
