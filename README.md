# My NixOS Configurations

This repository contains my NixOS configurations for all my machines.

## Bootstrapping

Here is the script you need to run to get this working:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need to have an SSH key to authorize GitHub with,
> and have access to the Ghostty GitHub repository as I
> use Ghostty and Ghostty is in private beta at the moment.

```sh
sudo nix-shell --packages git nu nix-output-monitor --command "
  git clone https://github.com/RGBCube/NixOSConfiguration ~/Configuration
  cd ~/Configuration
  nu rebuild.nu <host>
"
```

`host` is a host selected from the hosts in the `hosts` directory.

## Applying Changes

Lets say you have changed the configuration and want to apply the changes
to your system. You would have to run the rebuild script:

```sh
./rebuild.nu
```

This runs the script interactively.

You can also check how the script is used:

```sh
./rebuild.nu --help
```

This outputs:

```
Usage:
  > rebuild.nu (host) ...(arguments)

Flags:
  -h, --help - Display the help message for this command

Parameters:
  host <string>: The host to build. (optional, default: '')
  ...arguments <any>: The arguments to pass to `nix system apply`.
```
